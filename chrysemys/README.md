# Chrysemys

A 34-key keyboard created with [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz).

## Inspiration

### GergoPlex

The [GergoPlex](https://www.gboards.ca/product/gergoplex) is a 36 key keyboard which I purchased as a partialy assembled board. The key layout is excellent, however the thumb keys are slightly too far in towards the hands, and the split design results in my keyboard halves wandering away from me, or hard to use on uneven surfaces. I worked around some of these problems by creating a board in which the two halves are nestled in just the right orientation, however that does not help the thumb key issue.

### Hummingbird

The [Hummingbird layout](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird), and [Rufous, the Ergogen recreation](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae/tree/main/rufous) have been a big help in getting me started with Ergogen and building the layout I'm looking for.
