# Chrysemys

A 34-key single-board keyboard created with [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz).

## Design Goals

- Bluetooth connectivity.
- Single board, with an outward rotation between the two halves for ergonomic comfort.
- Using the ZMK firmware, as it has the best bluetooth support at the moment.
- A focus on keeping the entire keyboard as thin as possible.

## Bill of Materials

Work in progress

- 34 [Kailh Low-Profile Mini Choc Switches (CPG1232)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000277394324.html)
  - Note: These are the "mini" swtiches, which are not compatible with the normal Choc layout.
- 1 package [Kailh Low-Profile Keycaps](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32979973961.html)

## Inspiration

### GergoPlex

The [GergoPlex](https://www.gboards.ca/product/gergoplex) is a 36 key keyboard which I purchased as a partialy assembled board. The key layout is excellent, however the thumb keys are slightly too far in towards the hands, and the split design results in my keyboard halves wandering away from me, or hard to use on uneven surfaces. I worked around some of these problems by creating a board in which the two halves are nestled in just the right orientation, however that does not help the thumb key issue.

### Hummingbird

The [Hummingbird layout](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird), and [Rufous, the Ergogen recreation](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae/tree/main/rufous) have been a big help in getting me started with Ergogen and building the layout I'm looking for.
