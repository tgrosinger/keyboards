# Keyboards by Tony

Resources and designs for the custom keyboards I have created.

## The Keyboards

### Chrysemys

[Source Files](https://git.sr.ht/~tgrosinger/keyboards/tree/main/item/chrysemys)

A 34-key single-board keyboard created with [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz). Powered by a ProMicro-compatible board, such as the nice!nano.

This keyboard is my first attempt at using Ergogen, and my first custom keyboard, so it will likely be rough around the edges. I predict there will be future keyboards listed here which refine the ideas implemented in this board.

### Future Keyboards

I'd like to eventually work towards putting the MCU directly on the keyboard PCB. It however does not seem wise to do this until I have a functional keyboard under my belt.
