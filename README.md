# Keyboards by Tony

Resources and designs for the custom keyboards I have created.

## The Keyboards

### Chrysemys

[Source Files](https://git.sr.ht/~tgrosinger/keyboards/tree/main/item/chrysemys)

A 34-key single-board keyboard created with [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz). Powered by a ProMicro-compatible board, such as the nice!nano.

This keyboard is my first attempt at using Ergogen, and my first custom keyboard, so it will likely be rough around the edges. I predict there will be future keyboards listed here which refine the ideas implemented in this board.

### Pseudacris

[Source Files](https://git.sr.ht/~tgrosinger/keyboards/tree/main/item/pseudacris)

A 34-key single-board keyboard created with [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz). Powered by an integrated MCU, derived directly from the [nRFMicro](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/).

This keyboard is almost identical to Chrysemys, but switches to normal Choc switches, adds hotswap, and moves the switches closer together.

### Future Keyboards

Eventually I would like to build a keyboard which has an integrated trackpoint, trackpad, or trackball. It will likely be based on Pseudacris.
